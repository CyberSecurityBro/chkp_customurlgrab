# chkp_customurlgrab
pull custom urls from objects in your Check Point policy

This was a request from a customer and there is no direct way to pull it with the api but you can script it out.

Steps:
1.  Create script file on management server
2.  Add a username and password in script that have at least read access
3.  Save file
4.  chmod +x filename.sh
5.  run ./filename.sh

Hope that helps
